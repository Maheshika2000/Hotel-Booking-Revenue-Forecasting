# Hotel-Booking-Revenue-Forecasting

Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting monthly hotel revenue for Lanka Sportreizen (LSR) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model.
The goal is to help hotel management identify seasonal patterns, anticipate demand, and make data-driven decisions for pricing, staffing, and marketing.

The model is trained using 2,461 booking records collected from Booking.com, cleaned and aggregated into monthly revenue data. Forecasts are generated for the next 6 months.

🧠 Project Objectives

Collect and preprocess hotel booking/financial data

Calculate actual revenue (Total Payment – Commission)

Aggregate monthly revenue for time-series forecasting

Build and train an LSTM deep learning model

Evaluate model accuracy (using RMSE)

Forecast next 6 months of revenue

Visualize results and trends
